 Iris Flower Classification
Project Title: Iris Flower Classification
Company: NOVANECTAR SERVICES PVT. LTD.

Project Overview
This project is focused on developing a machine learning system to classify Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The system uses the Iris dataset, which includes features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Various classification algorithms are implemented to achieve accurate classification, and model performance is evaluated using key metrics.

Task Description
Data Collection and Preprocessing: Collect and preprocess the Iris dataset.
Algorithms Implemented: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Model Training and Validation: Train and validate models to classify Iris flower species.
Performance Evaluation: Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Model Optimization: Tune hyperparameters for improved model accuracy.
Documentation: Provide comprehensive documentation on the development process, model architecture, and usage guidelines.
Files Included
Iris.csv: The original Iris dataset used for training and evaluation.
Iris(1).csv: An additional version of the Iris dataset, if applicable.
IRIS_FLOWERS_CLASSIFICATION: Main script or notebook for classification tasks.
README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions.
